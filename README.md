Abstract
This report addresses predictive modeling for order fulfillment outcomes
in an e-commerce context using data-driven approaches. Using
machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, and XGBoost, the study identifies the most influential factors
impacting order statuses, evaluates fulfillment type performance, analyzes
shipping and customer demographics, and uncovers seasonal
delivery patterns. The final model enables organizations to enhance
logistics efficiency and customer satisfaction.
